            <p class="pb-2">Meet Magento Romania, as all Meet Magento events, is an open and inclusive event. We are committed to providing a safe environment where all participants are treated with kindness, fairness, respect, and tolerance. By following this code of conduct, you help us create a positive experience for everyone.</p>
            <h2 class="pb-3 pt-4">Guidelines</h2>

            <p class="pb-2">It applies at all times in physical and digital venues related to the event, including social media and other channels of communication. We believe people should follow these rules outside of our event activities too.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc md:list-disc pl-12">

            <h2 class="pb-3 pt-4">Enforcement</h2>
            <p class="pb-2">Any participant who violates these rules, whether accidentally or on purpose, will be asked to stop immediately.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">We reserve the right to take any appropriate action to protect other participants and maintain a safe environment. This includes permanently banning the violator from all event venues without a refund.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">In extreme circumstances we will contact the police or appropriate authorities.</p>
            <h2 class="pb-3 pt-4">Reporting</h2>
            <p class="pb-2">If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">All information you provide will be treated confidentially unless we need to disclose it to appropriate third parties such as the police. If the violation involves one of our organisers, they will be recused from handling your report.</p>
            <h3 class="pb-3 pt-3">Make a Personal Report</h3>
            <p class="pb-2">By making a personal report, we'll be able to reach out to you and discuss what has happened and how we can help you feel safe for the duration of the event. We'll do this before taking any action. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.</p>

            <h3 class="pb-3 pt-3">Make an Anonymous Report</h3>
            <p class="pb-2">You can also submit an anonymous report. While this means we won't be able to follow up with you directly to gather more details or discuss options, we will still fully investigate the issue and take whatever action is necessary.</p>
